# AirTAK - Standalone ADS-B to TAK Gateway

[AirTAK](https://www.snstac.com/blog/introducing-airtak-v1) is a standalone ADS-B to [TAK](https://www.tak.gov) Gateway. AirTAK Open Source is the purpose-built 
operating system used by AirTAK gateways. It is based on Debian, and runs on most ARM64
small-board computers, including the Raspberry Pi.

You can [download the latest build of AirTAK R01 here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BT053aHiCUGOuCLW_IXkkuzRCJurwJOw/view?usp=sharing).

Don't want to roll your own? You can order an assembled & tested [AirTAK go-kit](https://www.snstac.com/store/p/airtak-v1).


## What does AirTAK Do?

Any smartphone or computer running ATAK, WinTAK or iTAK, when paired to an AirTAK gateway, 
displays aircraft data in native TAK formats.

For example, in this field configuration, a Samsung Galaxy S20 smartphone running ATAK was paired to an AirTAK device carried in a backpack. The AirTAK was powered by a portable USB battery 
also in the backpack. No outside internet connectivity (no LTE, no WiFi) was utilized by the smartphone or AirTAK gateway

On a sunny & warm June day in downtown San Diego, a range of 55 miles was achived using this 
configuration.

## How does AirTAK work?

![AirTAK CONOP](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/6477cab5986c146297acea21/4090f1e7-e65e-45f9-92de-26907b2d46bc/airtak+conop.png?format=512w)

AirTAK creates a standalone ADS-B to TAK Gateway using WiFi. When paired with an ATAK, 
WinTAK or iTAK end-user device, AirTAK displays real-time aircraft data in native TAK 
formats. This allows TAK users to gain airspace situational awareness in an easily 
portable, turn-key device. When connected to a local or wide area network, AirTAK extends the operational coverage area and incrases airspace situational awareness.


## Where is AirTAK used?

AirTAK is in active use by wildland fire, security, safety & response organizations world-wide.

This work is funded by the [Colorado Center of Excellence for Advanced Technology Aerial Firefighting](https://www.cofiretech.org/feature-projects/team-awareness-kit-tak) and the [USDA Forest Service (USFS)](https://www.fs.usda.gov/managing-land/fire).
